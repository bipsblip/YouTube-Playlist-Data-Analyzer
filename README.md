# YouTube-Playlist-Data-Analyzer
This is my automation tool that features WEB SCRAPING using JavaScript, that also provides details of any YouTube playlist, like showing the time needed to watch the whole playlist at different speeds. 
Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. The web scraping software may directly access the World Wide Web using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or a web browser. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler. It is a form of copying in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis.

## Features
- It analyzes the playlist to find out the name, number of videos and views of the playlist.
- It finds the names, number of views and time length of all the videos of that playlist to give you a precise well-organised list.
- It calculates the total duration required to cover the playlist.
- It calculates the name of the average length of videos in the playlist.
- It also calculates the duration required to cover the whole playlist at 1.25x, 1.5x, 1.75x and 2x speed.
- It can create a PDF and spreadsheet of the title names, video length and the number of views of all the playlist videos.
- Most importantly, this code works fine for playlists of any number of videos, whereas, other tools work for playlists that contain up to 500 videos.
